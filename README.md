## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive workflow

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing and learning on the new features of CSS (2023) in future projects and then try Tailwind CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - This helped me to easily create the bow shadow of the card.
- [CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - I really love this CSS feature, it didn't exist when I learned css. Useful !
- [CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - For a better CSS start.
- [Using CSS Nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting) - New feature I didn't know about, very useful too.
- [Pixels to Rem converter](https://nekocalc.com/fr/px-a-rem-convertisseur) - To convert easily
